# Lovely Css

This is a pick out of [quasar-framework](https://quasar-framework.org) classes, which
are used for layout, colors, elevations and so on. Mind you, component related styles are
ommitted from this repo. It is written in sass and I look forward to add more.

**NOTE** Classes beggining with 'q-' has the prefix removed but the class still remains the same, e.g. `q-ma-xs` becomes `ma-xs`
